# Telemetry

## A Data Structures and Algorithms library

<br>
A Data Strctures and Algorithms library intended to replicate the major functionality of the STL, in a simplified form. 

**Implemented by Utkarsh Pant. www.linkedin.com/in/utkarshpant**

**I write about the process at www.medium.com/@Utkarsh.pant**

<br>

## Features

Telemetry implements **Linked Lists** and **Stacks (so far)** along with the major operations supported by each of them. 

<br>

## TODO's

1. Implement **Queues**.
2. Start working on Algorithms (Start with the List::Sort algorithm).
3. read about and implement testing methods. 
4. Implement a way to _time_ execution, for comparison with STL functions.
